---FootPain Website---

INTRODUCTION:
This is a website I developed for a podiatrist. He was initially using a Wordpress-based website for his practice. I offered to redesign his site using React and Flux.

ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN:
This website uses the following technologies on the front-end: 
    -HTML / CSS (SAAS)
    -React / Flux

Note: At the time of this writiing, there is no back-end to this website. All design and workflows are build using the previously mentioned front-end technologies.
